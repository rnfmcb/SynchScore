To use this program, create a control file. The control can be one sample from the data set. 
Enter how many samples and how many genes there will be in the data file 
The Program will then compare the samples to the control file and find the difference between each gene of the control and the gene of each of the samples 
The closer to 0 the sample is to the control, the more similar the sample is to the control. 
The program averages the differences to calculate the sychScore. The closer to 0 the number is, the more synchrocity the data is. Lower number is better. 
The program will output the differences in an output file for additional information about the genes.
